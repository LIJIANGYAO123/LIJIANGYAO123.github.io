## Project Overview

This project focuses on the critical issue of rural medical insurance enrollment in Ji'an City. As the **Data Analysis Lead**, I spearheaded a large-scale study that combined big data from social media with traditional field surveys to identify the core drivers of user purchase intention. Our team was awarded the **National First Prize** in the "Zhengda Cup" Market Research Competition.

## Key Methodologies & Impact

### 1. Social Media Data Mining (NLP)
To capture authentic public sentiment, I utilized Python to scrape over **19,000 social media texts**. 
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Quantified public emotion trends regarding medical insurance policies.
* **Topic Modeling:** Applied **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)** to extract hidden themes and concerns from unstructured comments.

### 2. Quantitative Modeling
We integrated the online data with **1,143 field survey samples** to build a comprehensive dataset.
* **Feature Selection:** Used **Random Forest** algorithms to rank the importance of various socioeconomic factors.
* **Driver Identification:** Applied **Logistic Regression** to mathematically model the probability of enrollment, successfully identifying the key determinants of satisfaction and purchase willingness.

### 3. Achievement
The research provided data-driven policy recommendations for local authorities and won the **National First Prize**, demonstrating the effective application of machine learning in social science research.
