## Project Overview

This project addresses the critical bottleneck in life insurance customer service: the low accuracy and high latency of retrieving complex policy information. As the **Project Lead**, I designed and implemented a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that enables natural language querying of unstructured insurance documents.

## Key Solutions & Impact

### 1. RAG Architecture Implementation
Constructed a metadata-driven **Knowledge Graph** to structure messy policy data. This allowed the system to understand the context of insurance clauses better than standard vector search.

### 2. Model Fine-tuning
Fine-tuned the base LLM using **4,255 entries of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data**. This significantly improved the model's ability to recognize specific insurance intents and classify user queries accurately.

### 3. Business Impact
The system achieved complex table calculation capabilities and multi-product comparison functions. In live testing, it increased business query efficiency by **30x**, transforming a manual workflow into an automated AI-assisted process.

## Tech Stack Details

* **Core Logic:** Python, LangChain
* **Models:** OpenAI (Base), Custom Fine-tuned Model
* **Data:** Vector Database for retrieval, Knowledge Graph for structure
